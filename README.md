EventTrackr

EventTrackr streamlines roll call functionality for events. The database contains users, events and members with the ability for event organizers to take attendance and note who was present. A future reporting feature would allow event organizers to analyze data on their events and groups. There is also potential to categorize members into different sub-groups in the future.
